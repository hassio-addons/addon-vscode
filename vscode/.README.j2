Visual Studio Code, accessible through the browser.

## About

This add-on runs Visual Studio Code, allowing you to edit your Home Assistant
configuration straight from the web browser and can be embedded straight
into the Home Assistant frontend UI.

Visual Studio Code runs as a remote server using `code-server`, and is a
fully fledged VSCode experience.

The add-on has the Home Assistant, MDI icons and YAML extensions pre-installed
and pre-configured right out of the box. This means that auto-completion works
instantly, without the need for configuring anything.
